# Code Review CTF Challenge Java-Auth02: Authentication Bypass Bug


## Goal of the Challenge

The goal is to **identify the authentication bypass vulnerability** in the code by performing static analysis. The code is intentionally designed to be **minimal and straightforward**, focusing on a subtle vulnerability in the **password authentication process**. 

Please note:
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** and **Brute Force Protection** are not implemented, nor are they the focus of this challenge. 
- The code is purposefully light and straightforward to allow participants to focus on identifying the **authentication bypass vulnerability**.


### If You Solve the Challenge

Once you've identified the bug, exploit it to bypass the authentication. Post your solution on Twitter using the hashtag #CTFCodeReview and tag @coffeensecurity. Weâ€™ll be tracking submissions and will announce the winner two weeks after the post!
